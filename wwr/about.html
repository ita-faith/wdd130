            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>White water rafting, an adventurous outdoor activity, has its roots in the mid-19th century. 
                The first recorded attempt at navigating white water rapids was in 1842, when Lieutenant John Fremont and Horace H. Day used a rubber raft to explore the Platte River in the United States.
                 This early version of rafting was mostly for exploration and scientific expeditions.
                 Commercial white water rafting gained popularity in the 1960s and 1970s, particularly in the United States, when inflatable rafts became more accessible and safety gear improved.
                  Rivers like the Colorado River, which runs through the Grand Canyon, became iconic destinations for thrill-seekers. The rise of outdoor adventure tourism helped further popularize rafting around the world.
                Today, white water rafting is a globally recognized sport and recreational activity, ranging from serene float trips to adrenaline-pumping rapid runs classified from Class I (easy) to Class V (extremely difficult).
                 The sport continues to attract adventurers looking to experience the excitement of navigating turbulent river waters.
